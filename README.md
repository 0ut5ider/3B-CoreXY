# 3B-CoreXY
3B-CoreXY motion platform

A new mechanism for driving a toolhead. I call it 3B-CoreXY motion system.
The core idea was to shorten and simplify the belts as much as possible. 

What we have is a system which uses three closed belts, and two motors. The motors work the same way they do on a traditional corexy system (see video).
This system uses 3/4 the belt length of a traditional corexy setup, and arguably a much simpler belt routing.


Proof of convept video of the motion system in action.
